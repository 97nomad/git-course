Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. You can spend all day playing with mountains. Little short strokes. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll.

You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. Be brave. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. I'm a water fanatic. I love water.

This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Imagination is the key to painting. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen.

We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. A beautiful little sunset. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart.

It's all a game of angles. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Let's build an almighty mountain. With practice comes confidence. Let's have a nice tree right here.

We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. Every day I learn. In your world you have total and absolute power. Poor old tree.

We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Everybody needs a friend. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting.

A fan brush can be your best friend. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. You need the dark in order to show the light.

That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. This piece of canvas is your world.

Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Nothing wrong with washing your brush.

I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. We'll play with clouds today. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend.

We'll have a super time. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe.
